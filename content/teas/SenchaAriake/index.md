<b>Origin:</b><br />
: Kagoshima prefecture, Kyushu

<b>Colour:</b><br />
: Cloudy bright green colour

<b>Texture in the mouth:</b><br />
: Smooth and velvety

<b>Flavour:</b><br />
: slightly acidic

<b>Aromas:</b><br />
: Iodine to start, marine (raw fish and seaweed), vegetal (cooked vegetable to start followed by an underlying cut grass note), sweet aftertaste

<b>Notes:</b><br />
: The name of the tea comes from the former town of Ariake (有明町, Ariake-chō) located in Soo District, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. In 2006, Ariake, together Matsuyama, merged into the city of Shibushi.
: As most Japanese green tea, this tea is steamed (and not pan roasted). The characteristic of this Sencha in particular is that it is a *fukamushi* (深蒸し) or deep steamed Sencha. Fukamushi tea is steamed for 1-2', in contrast with *futsuumushi* (普通蒸し) or normal steamed tea, for 30''-1', and *asamushi* (浅蒸し) or light steamed tea, for less than 30''. Despite the process is generally reserved to Sencha, other Japanese green teas can be deep steamed too.
: The longer steaming process imparts special characteristics to the tea. The leaves are so soft after steaming that, during the following step of the process, i.e. rolling, they tend to break, thus explaining the quantity of fragments present in the tea along with the leaves. This explains why in Japan specially designed teapots, with a larger filter and a finer mesh, are used for fukamushicha. Moreover, the tea is less astringent and sweeter, and this counterbalances the usual umami taste of Sencha.

: This particular tea is produced in limited quantity (22 kg) for the seller.

Il Sencha Ariake è un'ottimo Tè verde giapponese proveniente dal Kyushu, isola situata nel sud del paese. Sapore freschissimo, delicato e leggermente floreale. Si differenzia dagli altri Sencha Giapponesi in quanto subisce un trattamento termico più lungo. E' un Tè verde raffinato, di qualità superiore.


This Ariake Fukamushi Sencha, like most of Japanese green teas, is steamed rather than pan roasted. However it is rather more special as it undergoes a lengthier steaming processes, referred to as deep steaming. In Japanese, fukamushi (深蒸し) means ‘deep steamed’ as the tea is steamed for 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual futsuumushi (普通蒸し) steaming, which is only 30 seconds to 1 minute. There is also an even lighter version that is called asamushi (浅蒸し) or ‘light steamed’ tea, which undergoes steaming for less than 30 seconds. Even though gyokuro, kabusecha and even bancha can be deep steamed, it is usually senchas that undergo such treatment. Therefore ‘fukamushicha’ will usually refer to a deep steamed sencha.

This longer steaming process makes quite a big difference to the flavour of the tea. It diminishes the astringency and increases sweetness, resulting in a good balance between the classic umami depth and a pleasing sweet aftertaste. The steaming process makes the tea leaves very soft, so during the next processing stage, which is rolling, the leaves and tips can often break. This results in variable leaf size, with many very small broken leaf fragments. It can appear like a low-quality sencha, but the reality is completely the opposite as it the result of the specialised deep steaming process.

When brewed, fukamushicha also has a stronger, more vibrant, green color, with a cloudy liquor and sediment visible. There are Japanese teapots specifically designed for brewing fukamushicha, which have a finer brewing mesh with a larger surface area so that it doesn’t get clogged with the fine tea particles. We recommend using a very fine mesh infuser if you have one. On the plus side, having fine particles in your tea can increase the health benefits, as you will be consuming more leaves (and their catechins, fibre, vitamins, and chlorophyll), very much akin to matcha drinking!

Ariake Fukamushi Sencha has aromatic dark green leaves that produce a cloudy but vibrantly bright green liquor. It has a typical savoury and vegetal green sencha aroma. The taste is surprisingly delicate, reminiscent of fresh green vegetables. The profile has a mild umami and savoury body, yet is refreshing and has a pronounced sweetness on the aftertaste. Compared to other senchas, the deep steaming results in greatly reduced astringency, making this an easy drink – the brisk flavour and vegetal umami notes give way to a pleasantly sweet, smooth aftertaste.

We highly suggest brewing at 70°C (not to burn or damage the delicate leaves) for just 1 minute. It can be brewed at least 3 times.
