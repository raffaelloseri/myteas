<b>Notes:</b><br />
: Laoshan village is near Qingdao in the province of Shandong at an altitude of just 300 meters.  Laoshan village is also near a sacred mountain, and not far from the ocean.  Tea has been grown in Laoshan area for many generations.  
: Our Laoshan teas are grown by the Liang family, who have a small family operation growing Laoshan tea and doing all the processing of the tea themselves as well.  You will notice that the tea is grown undercover of greenhouse which are fully covered in the winter to protect from frost and also in the earliest part of spring as well just as the leaves are starting to sprout.  In the middle and later part of the first flush growth stage the coverings are removed and the tea bushes grow in full view of the sun until plucking in the first week of April.  Our Classic Laoshan Green is first flush flush tea, picked in April.
: Our Classic Laoshan green tea is small leaf, tippy (but without silver hairs) and tightly rolled, but not compressed like a Tie Guan Yin.  The varietal grown is Long Jing #43 and as such the tea from Laoshan shares it character.  The Classic Laoshan taste is thick, pungent, savory and vegetal.  It's perhaps slightly less sweet than the first flush Imperial Grade, having slightly larger and thicker leaves gives this tea a more robust flavor.  Many seasoned tea drinkers might appreciate the niceties of the the more elegant Imperial Grade, but may find themselves wanting to drink the Classic grade for it's pungent green taste (which is very stimulating).  I find the classic grade to be very enjoyable and a worthy counterpoint to the daintier Imperial grade.
: We feel confident you will enjoy family-sourced Laoshan teas and invite you to try them all!
